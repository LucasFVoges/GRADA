\usage{
grada_analyze(
  PE = TRUE,
  seq = NULL,
  read1 = NULL,
  read2 = NULL,
  M_min = 0,
  M_max = 2,
  output = "temp/",
  numCores = detectCores()/2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{PE}{paired data? TRUE / FALSE (std. TRUE)}

\item{seq}{sequences to search for (adapters) (A text file containing:">Name
Sequence
IlumniaUniversalAdapter
AGATCGGAAGAGC")}

\item{read1}{Path to R1 read file (std. NULL)}

\item{read2}{Path to R2 read file (if paired data, std. NULL)}

\item{M_min}{minimal mismatches allowed (std. 0)}

\item{M_max}{maximal mismatches allowed (std. 2)}

\item{output}{the folder where all data will be created. (std. "temp/")}

\item{numCores}{Number of cores to use. If numCores=1 then the normal lapply function is used and the parallel package is not neccessary! (std. detectCores()/2)}
}
\value{
A Table as .txt of the found sequences (adapters) and .txt files containig reads per sequence and mistake.
}
\description{
This function will perform a unix "agrep" and "wc" to look through the read.fastq files. This will be iterativly done for each mismatch allowed (note: mismatches are only other characters - if the adapter sequence is overlaping it will not be found). The Mismatches can't be bigger then the shortest sequence!
